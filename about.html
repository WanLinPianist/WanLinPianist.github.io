<p>Bio
Dr. Wan Lin is a pianist, choral conductor, and music educator whose artistic voice resonates across cultures and disciplines. Born in China and trained in Singapore, London, and the United States, she brings a rare global perspective to her work, bridging East and West, tradition and innovation, solo and collaborative music-making. While rooted in classical piano performance, her artistic practice extends into choral direction, cross-cultural programming, and international education. She believes in music as a bridge, not only between cultures, but also across generations, stories, and shared human experience.
Educated across four countries, Dr. Lin earned her Doctor of Musical Arts in Piano Performance and Literature, with a cognate in Choral Music, from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the guidance of Prof. Timothy Ehlen, where she graduated with a perfect GPA and held full scholarships throughout her academic journey. Her doctoral research <em> Music Born of Wars: Performing Chinese Nationalism and Patriotism in Twentieth-Century Piano Arrangements </em> examined how piano music can serve as a medium for cultural identity and political memory. She also holds a Master of Music from Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where she studied with the legendary pianist Prof. André Watts as his sole admitted student that year, a Bachelor of Music with First-Class Honours from the Royal College of Music in London, and a Diploma with Distinction from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore.
Performed internationally, Dr. Lin has appeared on stages across China, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In May 2025, she completed a five-city solo recital tour in China presented in collaboration with Steinway & Sons. China Daily described the tour as “rooted in Western classical repertoire and infused with Eastern aesthetics, fostering cultural dialogue between East and West,” a reflection of her commitment to intercultural musical storytelling. She has also appeared as a concerto soloist under maestro Ian Hobson. Her recital programs often reflect her interest in narrative-driven repertoire, combining the classical canon with contemporary Chinese works.
Collaborated widely, Dr. Lin is also an active ensemble pianist and conductor. As the principal pianist, she performed extensively with conductor Andrew Megill and the UIUC Chamber Singers. As chorus conductor of the Jasmine Field Orchestra, she led more than ten public concerts, programming multilingual and cross-period repertoire with a focus on contemporary Chinese choral music.
Recognized for both artistic and academic excellence, Dr. Lin has received numerous honors, including first prizes at the University of Illinois Concerto Competition, the Nanyang International Music Competition, and the NAFA International Chopin Piano Competition. She was also awarded full scholarships throughout her graduate studies and distinctions such as the President’s Award, the Best Graduate Award, and the Frida Jones Memorial Award.
Appointed as an educator in both collegiate and community settings, Dr. Lin brings over a decade of teaching experience. At Indiana University, she served as an Associate Instructor in piano, and at the University of Illinois, she worked as an Accompanying Assistant, coaching voice majors. Her private studio, active since 2013, has nurtured prize-winning students admitted to leading conservatories. She also presents lectures and masterclasses through Steinway & Sons’ Educational Partner Program. Her teaching philosophy emphasizes music as story, memory, and meaning, encouraging not only artistic excellence but personal growth, and inspiring students to think deeply, listen openly, and play with purpose.
Engaged in leadership and service, Dr. Lin currently serves as President of the World Piano Teachers Association USA–Illinois Chapter and as Deputy Secretary-General of the Collaborative Piano Division within the Guangdong Vocal Association in China. A member of the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA), she is also a sought-after adjudicator for both national and international piano and vocal competitions. Her commitment to professional advocacy and cross-cultural collaboration continues to shape her contributions to the global music education community.
Guided by a global artistic vision, Dr. Wan Lin continues to foster dialogue between musical traditions, shaping not only musicians, but communities through the transformative power of music.
